# Landing Site

Marketing site built using Jekyll and based on the [Hydra](https://github.com/CloudCannon/hydra-jekyll-template) template.

## Setup

* Local version of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

## Develop

Hydra was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
